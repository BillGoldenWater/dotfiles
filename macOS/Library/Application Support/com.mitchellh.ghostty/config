# The font families to use.
# 
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
# 
#     ghostty +list-fonts
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
# 
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
# 
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
# 
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
# 
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
# 
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
# 
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
# 
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
font-family = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"

# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
# 
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect existing
# terminals that have NOT manually adjusted their font size in some way
# (e.g. increased or decreased the font size). Terminals that have manually
# adjusted their font size will retain their manually adjusted size.
# Otherwise, the font size of existing terminals will be updated on
# reload.
# 
# On Linux with GTK, font size is scaled according to both display-wide and
# text-specific scaling factors, which are often managed by your desktop
# environment (e.g. the GNOME display scale and large text settings).

# the selection color is just the inverted window background and foreground
# (note: not to be confused with the cell bg/fg).
# Specified as either hex (`#RRGGBB` or `RRGGBB`) or a named X11 color.
# Since version 1.2.0, this can also be set to `cell-foreground` to match

selection-background = #484848
# The minimum contrast ratio between the foreground and background colors.
# The contrast ratio is a value between 1 and 21. A value of 1 allows for no
# contrast (e.g. black on black). This value is the contrast ratio as defined
# by the [WCAG 2.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
# 
# If you want to avoid invisible text (same color as background), a value of
# 1.1 is a good value. If you want to avoid text that is difficult to read, a
# value of 3 or higher is a good value. The higher the value, the more likely
# that text will become black or white.
# 
# This value does not apply to Emoji or images.

# 
#   * `cell-foreground` - Match the cell foreground color.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
#   * `cell-background` - Match the cell background color.

# The color of the text under the cursor. If this is not set, a default will

# the cell foreground color, or `cell-background` to match the cell
# background color.

# The size of the scrollback buffer in bytes. This also includes the active

# allocated for the visible screen and anything leftover is the limit for
# the scrollback.
# 
# When this limit is reached, the oldest lines are removed from the
# scrollback.
# 
# Scrollback currently exists completely in memory. This means that the
# larger this value, the larger potential memory usage. Scrollback is
# allocated lazily up to this limit, so if you set this to a very large
# value, it will not immediately consume a lot of memory.
# 
# This size is per terminal surface, not for the entire application.
# 
# It is not currently possible to set an unlimited scrollback buffer.
# This is a future planned feature.
# 
# This can be changed at runtime but will only affect new terminal surfaces.

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`.
# 
# If the key is a single Unicode codepoint, the trigger will match
# any presses that produce that codepoint. These are impacted by
# keyboard layouts. For example, `a` will match the `a` key on a
# QWERTY keyboard, but will match the `q` key on a AZERTY keyboard
# (assuming US physical layout).
# 
# For Unicode codepoints, matching is done by comparing the set of
# modifiers with the unmodified codepoint. The unmodified codepoint is
# sometimes called an "unshifted character" in other software, but all
# modifiers are considered, not only shift. For example, `ctrl+a` will match
# `a` but not `ctrl+shift+a` (which is `A` on a US keyboard).
# 
# Further, codepoint matching is case-insensitive and the unmodified
# codepoint is always case folded for comparison. As a result,
# `ctrl+A` configured will match when `ctrl+a` is pressed. Note that
# this means some key combinations are impossible depending on keyboard
# layout. For example, `ctrl+_` is impossible on a US keyboard because
# `_` is `shift+-` and `ctrl+shift+-` is not equal to `ctrl+_` (because
# the modifiers don't match!). More details on impossible key combinations
# can be found at this excellent source written by Qt developers:
# https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qkeysequence.html#keyboard-layout-issues
# 
# Physical key codes can be specified by using any of the key codes
# as specified by the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).
# For example, `KeyA` will match the physical `a` key on a US standard
# keyboard regardless of the keyboard layout. These are case-sensitive.
# 
# For aesthetic reasons, the w3c codes also support snake case. For
# example, `key_a` is equivalent to `KeyA`. The only exceptions are
# function keys, e.g. `F1` is `f1` (no underscore). This is a consequence
# of our internal code using snake case but is purposely supported
# and tested so it is safe to use. It allows an all-lowercase binding
# which I find more aesthetically pleasing.
# 
# Function keys such as `insert`, `up`, `f5`, etc. are also specified
# using the keys as specified by the previously linked W3C specification.
# 
# Physical keys always match with a higher priority than Unicode codepoints,
# so if you specify both `a` and `KeyA`, the physical key will always be used
# regardless of what order they are configured.
# 
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
# 
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
# 
# Some additional notes for triggers:
# 
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
# 
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
# 
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
# 
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
# 
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
# 
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
# 
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (e.g. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
# 
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
# 
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
# 
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
# 
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
# 
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
# 
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable. Unbind will remove any matching trigger,
#     including `physical:`-prefixed triggers without specifying the
#     prefix.
# 
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. e.g. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
# 
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. e.g. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
# 
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     e.g. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
# 
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Some notes for the action:
# 
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
# 
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
# 
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
# 
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
# 
#  * `all:`
# 
#    Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#    keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#    then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#    applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#    are already global (e.g. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
# 
#    Available since: 1.0.0
# 
#  * `global:`
# 
#    Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work within Ghostty
#    and under the right conditions (application focused, sometimes terminal
#    focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work globally across your system
#    (e.g. even when Ghostty is not focused), specify this prefix.
#    This prefix implies `all:`.
# 
#    Note: this does not work in all environments; see the additional notes
#    below for more information.
# 
#    Available since: 1.0.0 on macOS, 1.2.0 on GTK
# 
#  * `unconsumed:`
# 
#    Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind will consume the input,
#    meaning that the associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the
#    running program in the terminal. If you wish to send the encoded value
#    to the program, specify the `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire
#    keybind. For example: `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and
#    `all:`-prefixed keybinds will always consume the input regardless of
#    this setting. Since they are not associated with a specific terminal
#    surface, they're never encoded.
# 
#    Available since: 1.0.0
# 
#  * `performable:`
# 
#    Only consume the input if the action is able to be performed.
#    For example, the `copy_to_clipboard` action will only consume the input
#    if there is a selection to copy. If there is no selection, Ghostty
#    behaves as if the keybind was not set. This has no effect with `global:`
#    or `all:`-prefixed keybinds. For key sequences, this will reset the
#    sequence if the action is not performable (acting identically to not
#    having a keybind set at all).
# 
#    Performable keybinds will not appear as menu shortcuts in the
#    application menu. This is because the menu shortcuts force the
#    action to be performed regardless of the state of the terminal.
#    Performable keybinds will still work, they just won't appear as
#    a shortcut label in the menu.
# 
#    Available since: 1.1.0
# 
# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
# 
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
# 
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS and certain Linux platforms.
# 
# On macOS, this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted
# to Ghostty. When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched
# or reloaded, Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions.
# If the permissions are not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS,
# you can find these permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security
# -> Accessibility.
# 
# On Linux, you need a desktop environment that implements the
# [Global Shortcuts](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts.html)
# protocol as a part of its XDG desktop protocol implementation.
# Desktop environments that are known to support (or not support)
# global shortcuts include:
# 
#  - Users using KDE Plasma (since [5.27](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.27.0/#wayland))
#    and GNOME (since [48](https://release.gnome.org/48/#and-thats-not-all)) should be able
#    to use global shortcuts with little to no configuration.
# 
#  - Some manual configuration is required on Hyprland. Consult the steps
#    outlined on the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#dbus-global-shortcuts)
#    to set up global shortcuts correctly.
#    (Important: [`xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland/)
#    must also be installed!)
# 
#  - Notably, global shortcuts have not been implemented on wlroots-based
#    compositors like Sway (see [upstream issue](https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/issues/240)).

# `window-padding-y = 2` will set both paddings to 2.

# Confirms that a surface should be closed before closing it.
# 
# This defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, surfaces will close without

# The position of the "quick" terminal window. To learn more about the
# quick terminal, see the documentation for the `toggle_quick_terminal`
# binding action.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `top` - Terminal appears at the top of the screen.
#   * `bottom` - Terminal appears at the bottom of the screen.
#   * `left` - Terminal appears at the left of the screen.
#   * `right` - Terminal appears at the right of the screen.
#   * `center` - Terminal appears at the center of the screen.
# 
# On macOS, changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty
# completely.
# 
# Note: There is no default keybind for toggling the quick terminal.
# To enable this feature, bind the `toggle_quick_terminal` action to a key.
quick-terminal-position = center

# The screen where the quick terminal should show up.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `main` - The screen that the operating system recommends as the main
#    screen. On macOS, this is the screen that is currently receiving
#    keyboard input. This screen is defined by the operating system and
#    not chosen by Ghostty.
# 
#  * `mouse` - The screen that the mouse is currently hovered over.
# 
#  * `macos-menu-bar` - The screen that contains the macOS menu bar as
#    set in the display settings on macOS. This is a bit confusing because
#    every screen on macOS has a menu bar, but this is the screen that
#    contains the primary menu bar.
# 
# The default value is `main` because this is the recommended screen
# by the operating system.
# 
# Only implemented on macOS.

# Whether the proxy icon in the macOS titlebar is visible. The proxy icon
# is the icon that represents the folder of the current working directory.
# You can see this very clearly in the macOS built-in Terminal.app
# titlebar.
# 
# The proxy icon is only visible with the native macOS titlebar style.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `visible` - Show the proxy icon.
#   * `hidden` - Hide the proxy icon.
# 
# The default value is `visible`.
# 
# This setting can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently
# open windows but only after their working directory changes again.
# Therefore, to make this work after changing the setting, you must
# usually `cd` to a different directory, open a different file in an
# editor, etc.

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the
# option key plus a character will sometimes produce a Unicode character.
# For example, on US standard layouts option-b produces "∫". This may be
# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
# 
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
# 
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed
# below, then the default value is "true". Otherwise, the default
# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
# 
#   - U.S. Standard
#   - U.S. International
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (e.g. `alt+ctrl+a`).
# 
# Explicit values that can be set:
# 
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
# 
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.

# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
# 
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
# 
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup
# time is a one-time cost. Additionally, single instance Ghostty is much
# more likely to have many windows, tabs, etc. so cgroup isolation is a
# big benefit.
# 
# This feature requires systemd. If systemd is unavailable, cgroup
# initialization will fail. By default, this will not prevent Ghostty
# from working (see linux-cgroup-hard-fail).
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `never` - Never use cgroups.
#   * `always` - Always use cgroups.
#   * `single-instance` - Enable cgroups only for Ghostty instances launched
#     as single-instance applications (see gtk-single-instance).

# This will be used to set the `TERM` environment variable.
# HACK: We set this with an `xterm` prefix because vim uses that to enable key
# protocols (specifically this will enable `modifyOtherKeys`), among other
# features. An option exists in vim to modify this: `:set
# keyprotocol=ghostty:kitty`, however a bug in the implementation prevents it
# from working properly. https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13211 fixes this.

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
# 
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to
# the project beyond standard network information mandated by the
# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.
# 
# If unset, we defer to Sparkle's default behavior, which respects the
# preference stored in the standard user defaults (`defaults(1)`).
# 
# Changing this value at runtime works after a small delay.
auto-update = check

# The release channel to use for auto-updates.
# 
# The default value of this matches the release channel of the currently
# running Ghostty version. If you download a pre-release version of Ghostty
# then this will be set to `tip` and you will receive pre-release updates.
# If you download a stable version of Ghostty then this will be set to
# `stable` and you will receive stable updates.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `stable` - Stable, tagged releases such as "1.0.0".
#  * `tip` - Pre-release versions generated from each commit to the
#    main branch. This is the version that was in use during private
#    beta testing by thousands of people. It is generally stable but
#    will likely have more bugs than the stable channel.
# 
# Changing this configuration requires a full restart of
# Ghostty to take effect.
# 
# This only works on macOS since only macOS has an auto-update feature.
